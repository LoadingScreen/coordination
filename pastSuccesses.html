      <h1>Past Successes</h1>
<hr>
<p>Before we continue, let's review cases where humanity has successfully dealt with (or is attempting to deal with) bad Nash equilibria in various domains (The categorisation is somewhat arbitrary, as several examples fit multiple categories.) Also note that I'm using the term “meme” here and elsewhere in the document in its original meaning<sup><a href="#df38:fn:1" class="footnote" id="df38:fn-back:1">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="#df38:fn:2" class="footnote" id="df38:fn-back:2">2</a></sup>.
</p>
<h2>Self-regulation</h2>
<ul><li><b>Asilomar:</b> The guidelines from the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA<sup><a href="#df38:fn:3" class="footnote" id="df38:fn-back:3">3</a></sup> are often given as an example of a successful industry self-regulation. Not only did the Asilomar Conference successfully set a precautionary precedent for the use of newly discovered DNA research methods, it also increased public interest and awareness of developments in the field.
</li></ul>
<h2>Government</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Smallpox:</b> The decade-long WHO campaign that eradicated naturally occurring smallpox<sup><a href="#df38:fn:4" class="footnote" id="df38:fn-back:4">4</a></sup>;
    </li>
  <li><b>Ozone:</b> UN-led Montreal Protocol that phased out ozone-depleting substances and fixed the ozone layer [ozone-fixed] [ozone-return]. Former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has called it “perhaps the single most successful international agreement to date” [wiki-montreal];
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Y2K Problem</b>: In 1999 the UN created an international cooperation centre<sup><a href="#df38:fn:5" class="footnote" id="df38:fn-back:5">5</a></sup> to mitigate the Y2K problem<sup><a href="#df38:fn:6" class="footnote" id="df38:fn-back:6">6</a></sup> [wiki-y2k]. Lacking prominent examples of averted disasters, its impact is hard to assess, but it certainly serves as an additional data point in the history of international coordination efforts;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Arms Treaties</b>: Various arms control treaties [wiki-acontrol], such as the Biological Arms Convention [wiki-bio-arms], Chemical Arms Convention [wiki-chem-arms] and Blinding Laser Weapons Protocol [wiki-lasers] [Importantly, the stability of arms treaties is a function of technological and geopolitical power balance: for instance, right now, Russia seems eager to back out of the soviet-signed *INF treaty* [wiki-irnft] to compensate for its weakness in conventional forces [russia-war]];
      </li>
</ul>
<h2>Activism and Memetics</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Tobacco:</b> The recent reduction in tobacco consumption [tobacco-drop] (especially in the developed world) [tobacco-1world] seems to be largely activism-related and memetic in origin;
    </li>
  <li>
    <b>Nuclear Waste:</b> Perhaps as a result of the aforementioned anti-nuclear campaign, when it comes to nuclear waste treatment and disposal, people seem to have concerns that span uncharacteristically long time horizons (Pointed out to me by Martin Rees <sup><a href="#df38:fn:7" class="footnote" id="df38:fn-back:7">7</a></sup>) <sup><a href="#df38:fn:8" class="footnote" id="df38:fn-back:8">8</a></sup>. People seem to care less about whether the future generations exist than they care about not burdening them with radioactive waste!
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Ideologies and Norms</b>: For better or for worse, religions and other mass-ideologies (e.g., liberalism, republicanism, human rights movement) have served as strong (possibly the strongest) group coordination mechanisms [s-signal] [fyama-orig]. Ideologies (some emergent, some engineered [wiki-sciento]) often bias the behaviour of individuals (“meme carriers”) towards what's good for the group and for the ideology (“the meme”) itself [disgust-coop] [goins-unity] [cop-corrupt];
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Anti-nuclear Campaign</b>: After World War II there was a systematic campaign by highly respected scientists and intellectuals, many of whom had been instrumental in the development of nuclear weapons, to turn people against further weapons development, build support for disarmament and international control, and highlight the health risks of nuclear technology. Many institutions were set up for this purpose, such as the Federation of American Scientists [wiki-fas] and the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists [wiki-bas] (see also the Russell-Einstein Manifesto [wiki-rem]). This may have had a large counterfactual effect on people's views about nuclear weapons and nuclear energy;
      </li>
    </ul>
<h2>Self-Enforcing Protocols</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Property Rights and Trade</b>: Probably the biggest coordination mechanisms invented so far. By requiring mutually agreeable prices and enabling the creation of markets, they enable division of labour and exploitation of different comparative advantages on a global scale [wealth-nations];
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Liturgies</b>: In ancient Greece the Athenians had a system called liturgies [liturgies] where the richest people were obligated to pay for public goods, such as defense and sports. The clever bit was ranking wealthy people by their (un)willingness to, in principle, exchange all their possessions with others: If person A won't willingly exchange all their possessions with person B, but person B does agree to such an exchange, A was presumed richer;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Harberger Tax:</b> In the 16th century, the Kingdom of Denmark taxed ships passing through the strait of Øresund based on self-declared value of their cargo. To keep skippers honest, the crown reserved the right to purchase the cargo at the declared price [danish-tax]. Eric Posner and Glen Weyl have proposed a generalized version of this self-assessment system in which anyone, not just the state, can buy any asset at the self-declared value [hanson-rents] [radical-mkts];
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>VAT:</b> Arguably, the emergence of the value added tax [vat-tax] as one of the world's dominant revenue instruments is largely due to its game-theoretic properties [schneier-proto]: businesses are incentivised to report to the government the invoices they have received, as that determines their VAT rebate;
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Blockchain:</b> Blockchain technologies [wiki-bchain] (discussed below in greater detail) often rely on self-enforcing protocols to establish various desired properties.
              </li>
